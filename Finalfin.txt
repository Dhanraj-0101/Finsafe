d
What are Mutual fund?
A mutual fund is a professionally managed trust, which pools the investors’ money and invests them into stocks, bonds, commodities, money market instruments and other securities. A mutual fund is like a basket of investments and your investment in the fund is a part of that basket.
The value of the mutual fund company depends on the performance of the securities it decides to buy. So when you buy a share of a mutual fund, you are actually buying the performance of its portfolio.
d
Advantages Of Mutual Funds
Diversification
Diversification reduces risk. Instead of buying shares, bonds, and other investments on your own. Mutual Fund  invests in assets on your behalf. This helps in reducing volatility.
Professional Management
The advantage of mutual funds is that they are managed by professional experts ( fund managers and research analysts).  They  will invest your money to buy and sell stocks after much research.
Simplicity
It is very easy to invest in mutual funds. There are online options available as well
.
Liquidity
Mutual funds are highly liquid. You  can, therefore, withdraw the money when were needed and  based on the asset class the money will be transferred in a minimum of 1 day or 3 days.
Can invest with small amounts
As low as Rs 500 or Rs 1000. Unlike other investments like real estate or stocks, mutual funds allow you to start as small as Rs 1000.per month.
Automated Investment
T
he Systematic Investment Plan or SIP helps you automate your investments.
Safe and transparent
All mutual fund companies come under the purview of SEBI and they need to make necessary disclosures.
d
Important Terms
Sponsor – As per SEBI regulations, a sponsor is a person or a combination with another corporate, who forms a mutual fund or gets the mutual fund registered.
Trustee – The sponsors form a trust and appoint a board of trustees through a Trust Deed. The trustees monitor the activities of the mutual fund and ensure that they comply to SEBI guidelines. The trustees have to report to SEBI every six months about the activities of the AMC.
Asset Management Company – Appointed by trustees for managing the mutual fund schemes.  Works under supervision of its Board of Directors, trustees and SEBI.
Fund Manager – Manages the portfolio of the mutual fund schemes.  Responsible for complying with the regulatory authorities and to protect the wealth and monitor the growth and performance of the fund.

d
What is NAV or Net Asset Value?
NAV is the total asset value (net of expenses) per unit of the fund.The final value of all the securities held in the portfolio is calculated daily, from this expenses are deducted.
NAV: Is used to calculate the number of units an investor can purchase or redeem in a scheme
The market value changes every day and this is reflected in the NAV of the scheme.
To check the performance of the scheme. While comparing two schemes, one must calculate the % increase in NAV and not the increase in the absolute amount
d
Expense Ratios
Expense ratio is the percentage of total assets that are spent to run a mutual fund
like administrative expenses, salaries, advertising expenses, brokerage fee, etc. A 1.5% expense ratio means the AMC charges Rs1.50 for every Rs100 in assets under management.
A fund’s expense ratio is typically to the size of the funds under management and not to the returns earned. The more assets in the fund, the lower should be its expense ratio.
Portfolio transaction fees, or brokerage costs, as well as initial or deferred sales charges are not included in the expense ratio.

d
What is Entry Load?

d
What is Exit Load?
An exit load is the amount charged from an investor for exiting or leaving a scheme or the company as an investor.
The motive of collecting exit load is to discourage investors from exiting the mutual fund scheme. Different mutual funds houses charge different fees as exit load.
Exit load in equity schemes is generally 1% if redeemed within one year from the date of investing.
Exit load on debt fund varies from 0 to 2% and minimum investment varies from 6 months to 2 years.

Gold – Finsafe Wellness
There are three methods to Invest in Gold. They are:
Sovereign Gold Scheme:
Issued by RBI on behalf of government of India
Sovereign guarantee
It is a substitute for holding physical gold
Minimum investment is 1gm and maximum is 4 KG
Investments & redemptions cannot be in the form of gold.
SGB have a interest rate of 2.5% p.a. payable semi annually.
Tenure of the bond is 8 years
Premature redemption is allowed from 5 th year and on the exchange
The redemption price on maturity is based on the average of closing price of gold (of 999 purity) for 3 days prioir to maturity.
Interest is taxable and there is no TDS applicable. There is no tax payable on capital gains received from maturity of the bond.
Gold Jewelry & Coins
It can be bought in the form of jewelry, coins or bars from the merchant and from a bank.
Gold jewelry cannot be considered as an investment due to the high overheads like making charges, wastage, etc.
One could take a loan against gold jewelry at the bank.
Overhead charges are higher when you sell the jewelry for cash. First, buyers melt the gold down. They do not pay for the style of the jewelry. Then, dealers must pay to melt the gold up to 30 percent of the value, to refine the precious metal. In the end, it is a buyer’s profit.
With physical gold one has to be worried about security, storage and purity of the gold
Gold ETF
The ideal form of investing in gold would be participating in the Gold Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).
A long term capital gain on Gold ETF is 1 year.
Gold ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is kept in a Demat form, and one need not worry about theft / loss.
Gold ETF tracks the price of the gold. Gold ETF is managed by the Mutual Fund and traded on NSE.
Gold ETF can be sold back in NSE (Exchange).
Purity levels of the gold are high as it is held in a Demat form.
Gold ETF can be liquidated at any given point of time.
In gold ETFs, investors track NAVs, which keep changing with gold prices. In e-gold, investors directly track the price of gold.

Our Story
Finsafe is a finance education organization focused on equipping people with strategies to handle their money with focus on goals, growth and safety. Finsafe’s vision is to transform 1 million people into intelligent investors by 2025. Together, we can usher in a new era of wealth-building for the nation.

This experience pointed out a worrying trend – most working young in India have little or no understanding of the basics of financial investment, making them vulnerable to wrong advice or uninformed decisions.

Finsafe was created to fill in the vacuum that exists in place of financial awareness. In-person trainings have limited scope in covering the length and breadth of India. Navigating past this roadblock, Finsafe came up with the webinars and e-learning courses, which has the power of engaging unlimited number of wealth-aspirants through the world-web.
The key objectives of Finsafe are to provide a scalable learning solution and a Knowledge Center to enable continuous learning in personal wealth management.

Financial independence and early retirement—a dream for many may remain a distant dream for many more. Finsafe India’s State of Financial Wellbeing at Workplace Report 2024-25, a survey taken by 4,289 working professionals, shows that being unprepared for long-term monetary goals and job loss are among the top financial challenges. This is not surprising, given that 50% of the respondents reported saving less than 20% of their take-home salary.
In fact, over the last three years that the annual survey has been conducted, the proportion of high savers (people saving > 40% of the take-home salary) has been declining, and there is a notable increase in the percentage of individuals who are not prepared for emergencies. Besides, an increasing majority of respondents are worried about achieving financial goals.
Indians are financially stressed, and this cannot bode well for the economy.
While people save, get insured and invest, they are not sure how to assess the right amount and instrument. Take the case of an emergency fund—one relies on what is in the savings account. With loans being readily available, individuals try to maximize returns by investing these funds in equities, not realizing the impact high-cost loans can have on one’s finances. A similar thought process plays out in the case of life insurance, which leads to people buying investment-linked insurance policies instead of focusing on life cover through a term plan.

Indian investors are discovering the power of factor investing
The three steps
Here is how people can address the two main financial stressors highlighted in the report, and get from being underinsured and underinvested to having enough capital for uncertainties and financial goals.
To start, set aside three to six months of expenses in a fixed deposit. It is the most accessible investment at the time of need.
Take an external health insurance cover in addition to the employer cover to have continuous coverage in case of job loss. The Arogya Sanjeevani would suffice as an additional cover. It is a standard health cover provided by all insurance companies.
The emergency fund can only help up to a point. With the changing job environment and financial goals getting costlier, one must build a good foundation by saving at least 30-40% of the take home. This can happen only by partially reducing lifestyle expenses and limiting monthly installments to 30% of the salary.

A person with high savings has investments compounding, whereas a person with high loans has the interest paid compounding. For example, A and B earn ₹10 lakh per year each, with both spending 30% on expenses. A invests 40% of the take-home salary and has 30% going towards loans. B invests 20% of the salary and has 50% of it going towards loan repayment. Assuming 10% p.a. return on investment (RoI) and loan interest at 9% p.a., at the end of 20 years, net of expenses and EMI, A will have ₹4.

SGBs and Gold ETF remain your best bets on the yellow metal
appeared first on

]]>
Currently, subscribers have two worries – will there be a huge fall in returns and is gold ETF a better option, given that the long-term capital gains tax on gold ETF has been reduced to 14.
Mrin Agarwal Financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pat Ltd and co-founder of Womantra
Some worries have been raised about the cutting back of customs duty on gold lowering the price of the yellow metal and thereby impacting the returns on sovereign gold bonds (SGBs). In fact, it has been alleged the government reduced the customs duty with an eye on bringing down the payout on SGBs. But, unlike what some of these circulating videos are purporting, the returns on SGBs have not fallen by 9 per cent.
SGBs gained popularity among investors given the tax-free returns and nil cost. The interest of 4.
A study of the SGB returns on July 29, 2024 versus the 52-week high (which was on July 18, 2024 for most of the series) reveals that the current returns are 1-2 per cent p.a lower.
For example, some of the 2017 series, which showed 15-16 per cent p.a. returns on the 52-week high are now returning 14-15 per cent p.a. Hence it is wrong to say that 15 per cent return will fall to 6 per cent p.a. Hence it is wrong to say that 15 per cent return will fall to 6 per cent p.a.
There are series which show higher fall, but this could be due to the premium that these series commanded pre-Budget. SGB premium is driven by demand, trading volumes and time left for maturity of the series. SGB had been in demand prior to the budget due to better taxation as compared to other financial forms of gold. Further low  trading volumes can cause some price spikes leading to high valuation. However, the maturity price of SGB is determined solely on the ongoing gold prices and that is dependent on many  parameters.
Gold prices in India are driven by the import duties as well as international gold prices and the USD-INR currency movement. Geopolitical events, central bank purchases, inflation, rate cuts are a few factors affecting international gold price movement. Given that the valuation of all other gold investments like gold ETF, physical gold is  based on the domestic price (which is driven by the above factors), SGB remains the best investment in gold due to zero cost, tax free returns and the additional 9. Further, premium turnover on index options has grown 426% in the last three years, compared to 30% growth in the cash turnover market.
High-fixed-return schemes like peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and low-rated bonds have traction among those looking for a regular return. Even unregulated schemes like managed farmlands, renewable asset leasing, gold savings schemes, invoice discounting, fractional property etc. are finding favour with ordinary investors as they promise high returns. Investors are simply unaware of these schemes’ structures or how they work. They still pour in money as they do not know how to weigh the risks with returns.

While regulators are making huge efforts to caution investors against dealing with unregulated entities, a few tax nudges can go a long way in getting investors to move in the right direction. This is even more essential now, as investor memory is short and most of the new investors have only seen rising markets. They do not really understand the downside of the high-risk strategies.
Indian citizens are allowed to invest in government bonds through the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) retail direct scheme. This provides a good option for citizens to lock in rates for 1-30 year periods. However, the uptake is low as the returns are fully taxable, and the platform is difficult to comprehend. In the past, bonds like deep-discount and tax-free infrastructure bonds have been popular with citizens. To encourage retail participation in long-term bonds and provide citizens with a viable option to invest for 1-40 years, the returns on certain sovereign bonds up to a limit can be made tax-free. Further, the government needs to make it easy to buy these bonds, like the sovereign gold bond scheme, to improve the adoption of government securities at a retail level.

Income tax deadline looms: Know your ITR forms to avoid penalties
Planning for retirement is the top financial concern for all Indians, and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a great instrument that can be used to build the retirement corpus and post-retirement pension. However, discrepancies exist in tax benefits for the salaried and the self-employed. While the salaried get the benefit of a tax deduction on corporate contributions under Section 80 CCD(2) in the old and new tax regimes, the self-employed get deductions only under the old tax regime under Section 80CCD(1B). This is unfair to them. To balance this disparity, the contributions by individuals to the NPS under Section 80CCD(1B) should be allowed as a deduction in the new tax regime as well.
If planning for retirement corpus is burdensome, planning for post-retirement regular income is a bigger challenge. Retirees often fall prey to schemes from unregulated entities or invest in low-rated bonds, mainly driven by the need for a reasonable post-retirement income. The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) and the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS) are two schemes widely used by retirees for regular income. The returns from these schemes can be made tax-free for senior citizens so that they can lead a better life and not have to take undue risks.

All these measures will help citizens have better personal finances over tax deductions (which, in most cases, get spent). The availability of government schemes like the NPS, SCSS, POMIS and government securities with additional tax benefits will nudge citizens to consider these regulated schemes over riskier/unregulated investments. This will also ensure household savings are not going into non-productive economic activity but nation-building.

The tax filing season is here. It is a taxing time for most people as they find the tax system complex and confusing. Deciding the regime, the ITR form and putting all data together for the filing are the common challenges. While individuals are focused on the housing sections and other tax deductions, there are 3 areas which need attention as well.
First, taxpayers need to check the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and reconcile it with their data. The AIS is a single, comprehensive document  which shows all financial transactions in a financial year. It carries information on income from salary, tax deducted at source, interest income, dividends, securities & immovable assets transactions, cash deposits, remittances and many more financial transactions.
It is essential to match the AIS with the taxpayer’s records to ensure accuracy in filing returns and avoiding notices and penalties. Many taxpayers are not aware of the need to do this. In case of a mismatch of data, the taxpayer has the ability to provide feedback and  the same is taken up with the reporting source.
Second, add capital gains from stocks and mutual funds to the tax calculation. There is a lack of awareness on the need to pay capital gains taxes. Further, the capital gains are also not being reported correctly with the sale date being shown as the last date of the financial year and calculation errors. For mutual funds, taxpayers can access the capital gains statement for the financial year, from the mutual fund registrars CAMS and Karvy Fintech. The statement has all the information on the date of purchase, date of sale and amount of capital gains tax. The statement can be downloaded in the excel format for further use.
Third, do not forget to declare foreign stocks holding. Most individuals believe that they do not need to declare foreign stocks until they sell the same. This is not true. Foreign stocks acquired directly or through company restricted stock unit (RSU) need to be declared under the Schedule of foreign assets(FA) in ITR2/ITR3. Schedule FA reporting is done on the accounting year of the foreign country, in Indian rupees. The assets need to be converted at the telegraphic transfer buying rate which is the exchange rate provided by State Bank of India.
Further, the capital gains on sale of foreign stocks is different from domestic stocks. The long-term capital gains on foreign stocks is applicable post holding the stock for 2 years and is taxed at 20% with indexations. Foreign stocks held for less than 2 years are taxable at slab. Dividend income from foreign stocks is to be shown in income from other sources and is taxed at slab. In case of withholding tax deduction by the foreign country, the taxpayer can claim tax credit under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement but would need to file Form 67 and then make the relevant declarations in Schedule TR and FSI.
The ITR filing of foreign stocks and capital gains is complex and it is recommended to take the help of a chartered account to file returns.
All the above are very important to file the ITR correctly and taxpayers must start working on the same right away.

Here are a few things investors can check to get their equity holdings to give better returns.
Mrin Agarwal Financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pvt. Ltd and co-founder of Womantra.
Of late, most enquiries around equity investments especially regarding systematic investment plans (SIP) are on investing in SIPs for short term periods of 1-2 years. Driven by good returns over the last couple of years, some investors believe the same performance will pan out over the next few years as well.
Based on previous market cycles, times like this, when lay investors make short term bets on equities, actually signals caution. Overconfidence precedes carelessness! It is appropriate for equity investors to take a reality check on their equity investors to take a reality check on their equity investments and investment behaviour.
Here are a few things investors can check to get their equity holdings to give better returns.
Firstly, have the equity investments been made for a financial goal or because markets were doing well and it seemed like a good time to make some quick money? All around one hears stories of fantabulous returns made in a short period. Tag a financial goal to all equity investments and have at least 7-10 years holding period. Investors who cannot do so should exit and invest as per their investment horizon. For example, if the holding period is 2 years, an ultra-short term fund or arbitrage fund would be recommended and not an equity fund as it can be very volatile.
Second, simplify the equity holdings. Investors tend to have too many funds. 4-5 funds spread across a large cap index fund, a midcap fund and a flexicap fund is all that a portfolio needs. Diversify within fund houses too to reduce overlap of stocks and to get a differentiated investment style. Allocate additional funds to existing funds.
Third, keep in mind a few things about equity markets. Markets will go up and down and do not give linear returns. Focus on what can be controlled like how much to invest, where to invest and remaining invested, over fretting about market movements. Long term investors gain nothing by checking prices/ NAVs everyday. Checking the portfolio on a half yearly basis is good enough.
Fourth, having a modest view always helps. Quick returns in the past are more luck than investing skill. Stock tips and influencer videos do not create long term wealth. Keep out the noise and do not get swayed by what everybody around is talking about. Tone down return expectations to an average return of 10-12% p.a. in the long term from equities.
Finally, keep the investment strategy simple. With equity markets doing well, investors seem to believe investments like stock baskets, equity trading, F&O etc will give better returns than mutual funds. There is no data to prove this. Further, individual investors do not have the resources to get the right information or the time required to micro manage direct equities. Mutual funds are best suited for individual investors.
A financial journey is a matter of choices and every choice investors make, makes their financial life.

Equities must be present in everyone’s portfolio, but that doesn’t mean you should take unnecessary risks. A simple combination of a Nifty 50 index fund and a Nifty 150 index fund might just be what the doctor ordered.
An investment has to be chosen based on two parameters – time frame of investment and risk.
The S&P BSE Sensex is hovering near all-time-high levels. And investors have caught the fever; the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) virus. There are many queries about what the next best investment is. They are afraid of being left behind as equity markets race ahead, and perhaps seeing their neighbour or friend making more money than they have so far. The reality is that quick returns are a one-off and cannot be sustained. Further, there is no such thing as the best investment that will consistently give 15 percent returns without any volatility.
The question still remains: Where to invest and how to go about managing these investments? Here is a process with five products to get the financial journey right for new investors and for existing investors to do a check and course correction.
Expect the unexpected
Job loss, a sudden medical emergency in the family, large repair expenses—these are just some unexpected events that can occur. Most often, people believe this will happen to others and not them. And when such an unfortunate event befalls them, it is common to hear that investments are not accessible and one ends up relying on loans. Before jumping into investing or taking a loan, keep five to six months of expenses in a fixed deposit. This can help you tide over financial emergencies.
External health insurance for internal peace
The salaried, especially younger employees,
tend to rely only on employer-provided health insurance
. However, these days, people at all ages are getting various illnesses and the cost of treatment is skyrocketing, meaning that the typical Rs 3-5 lakh of insurance cover provided under a group insurance scheme would prove insufficient. Also, one has to factor in job insecurity and instances where people prefer to follow their passion projects rather than stick to.a 9 to 5 routine. Given this, it is imperative to have external health insurance of at least Rs 5-10 lakh to ensure continuity of heath cover.
Put simply, one should take the plunge into the investment world only after ensuring an emergency corpus and health cover.
The “best” equity fund portfolio
An investment has to be chosen based primarily on two parameters—time frame and risk. The time horizon should be based on a financial goal and the risk is based on the risk an investor can or needs to take. Often, there is a gap between the amount required to be invested for a goal and the amount one can actually spare. In such instances, the money may have to be put into higher-risk avenues to meet the goal within the set time frame.
Given long-term inflation of 6-7 percent per annum, investors will need to consider instruments that beat this rate. One such investment is an equity fund. There are many categories within equity funds and it gets difficult to choose the allocation between those focused on large-, mid- and small-caps. Further,
mid- and small-cap stocks come with higher volatility,
something most investors find difficult to deal with. Investors are also confused with various theme- and sector-based funds.
One simple strategy is to invest in a combination of a simple Nifty 50 index fund and a Nifty 150 index fund. While this may not necessarily give the highest returns, it firstly removes the choice dilemma and secondly, helps investors remain invested.
Investors tend to churn mutual fund portfolios regularly based on recent performance, thus earning lower returns than the fund. Further, the SPIVA India year-end 2023 report by S&P Dow Jones shows that in a 10-year period, more than 50 percent of funds failed to beat the benchmark on an absolute returns basis, thus making a case for passive investing.
Plan for the short term with debt funds
Equities are for the longer term (at least seven years). For goals falling within three or four years, short-duration debt funds are a better bet, providing consistent returns. These funds have high-quality bond portfolios and exhibit lower volatility compared to other debt fund categories. Short-duration debt funds are all-weather funds and make returns through a combination of accrual and capital gains. They are preferred over fixed deposits as they provide better flexibility on withdrawal along with the possibility of better returns due to active duration management.
Think retirement, think NPS
Investors are getting more conscious about investing for retirement early on, given the expenses and corpus requirement.
The National Pension System
has all the elements that can help reach the required corpus. The lock-in till age 60 ensures money is left to compound and the equity allocation ensures higher returns. The additional tax benefit over Section 80C instruments is another positive.
These five products can go a long way in simplifying and magnifying one’s financial life.

An argument that is often heard against the National Pension Scheme(NPS) is the long lock-in till age of 60 years. Another concern is the accessibility of the corpus in case of early retirement.
Subscribers have for long been used to defined benefit scheme like the employee provident fund which gives a fixed return and find it difficult to estimate the corpus in NPS. They worry about how markets could be in the long run and the uncertainty associated with not getting a fixed return. One of the reasons annuity plans from insurance companies have so much acceptance is because they are sold with the promise of a certain amount and pension based on that.
However, these options may not provide a sufficient retirement corpus, given the limited returns in these plans. Based on current expenses of ₹75,000-1 lakh, the retirement corpus required at age 50, on an inflation adjusted basis, would be ₹6-8 crore for a 35-year old. For this, the individual will need to invest ₹0. The advantage there is that, at this point of time, 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn tax free and 40% goes into an annuity. A new feature in NPS also allows for withdrawal of the lump sum amount periodically under a systematic withdrawal plan (SLW).
The advantage that NPS has over equity mutual funds is lower cost and the pension. Retirees find it very difficult to plan for regular income from their corpus, whether they are 50 or 60 years old. This is something they do not need to worry about with NPS, since it provides periodic returns through pension and SLW. Equity funds have better liquidity and the investor can choose the risk allocation, but the ability to remain invested is the biggest hindrance in building a good retirement corpus.
The question that begets is whether early retirement is even possible, given the investment of ₹2-7.

Navigating past this roadblock, Finsafe came up with the webinars and e-learning courses, which has the power of engaging unlimited number of wealth-aspirants through the world-web.

Financial independence and early retirement—a dream for many may remain a distant dream for many more. Finsafe India’s State of Financial Wellbeing at Workplace Report 2024-25, a survey taken by 4,289 working professionals, shows that being unprepared for long-term monetary goals and job loss are among the top financial challenges. This is not surprising, given that 50% of the respondents reported saving less than 20% of their take-home salary.
In fact, over the last three years that the annual survey has been conducted, the proportion of high savers (people saving > 40% of the take-home salary) has been declining, and there is a notable increase in the percentage of individuals who are not prepared for emergencies. Besides, an increasing majority of respondents are worried about achieving financial goals.
Indians are financially stressed, and this cannot bode well for the economy.
While people save, get insured and invest, they are not sure how to assess the right amount and instrument. Take the case of an emergency fund—one relies on what is in the savings account. With loans being readily available, individuals try to maximize returns by investing these funds in equities, not realizing the impact high-cost loans can have on one’s finances. A similar thought process plays out in the case of life insurance, which leads to people buying investment-linked insurance policies instead of focusing on life cover through a term plan.

Indian investors are discovering the power of factor investing
The three steps
Here is how people can address the two main financial stressors highlighted in the report, and get from being underinsured and underinvested to having enough capital for uncertainties and financial goals.
To start, set aside three to six months of expenses in a fixed deposit. It is the most accessible investment at the time of need.
Take an external health insurance cover in addition to the employer cover to have continuous coverage in case of job loss. The Arogya Sanjeevani would suffice as an additional cover. It is a standard health cover provided by all insurance companies.
The emergency fund can only help up to a point. With the changing job environment and financial goals getting costlier, one must build a good foundation by saving at least 30-40% of the take home. This can happen only by partially reducing lifestyle expenses and limiting monthly installments to 30% of the salary.

A person with high savings has investments compounding, whereas a person with high loans has the interest paid compounding. For example, A and B earn ₹10 lakh per year each, with both spending 30% on expenses. A invests 40% of the take-home salary and has 30% going towards loans. B invests 20% of the salary and has 50% of it going towards loan repayment. Assuming 10% p.a. return on investment (RoI) and loan interest at 9% p.a., at the end of 20 years, net of expenses and EMI, A will have ₹4.

SGBs and Gold ETF remain your best bets on the yellow metal

Currently, subscribers have two worries – will there be a huge fall in returns and is gold ETF a better option, given that the long-term capital gains tax on gold ETF has been reduced to 14.
Mrin Agarwal Financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pat Ltd and co-founder of Womantra
Some worries have been raised about the cutting back of customs duty on gold lowering the price of the yellow metal and thereby impacting the returns on sovereign gold bonds (SGBs). In fact, it has been alleged the government reduced the customs duty with an eye on bringing down the payout on SGBs. But, unlike what some of these circulating videos are purporting, the returns on SGBs have not fallen by 9 per cent.
SGBs gained popularity among investors given the tax-free returns and nil cost. The interest of 4.
A study of the SGB returns on July 29, 2024 versus the 52-week high (which was on July 18, 2024 for most of the series) reveals that the current returns are 1-2 per cent p.a lower.
For example, some of the 2017 series, which showed 15-16 per cent p.a. returns on the 52-week high are now returning 14-15 per cent p.a. Hence it is wrong to say that 15 per cent return will fall to 6 per cent p.a. Hence it is wrong to say that 15 per cent return will fall to 6 per cent p.a.
There are series which show higher fall, but this could be due to the premium that these series commanded pre-Budget. SGB premium is driven by demand, trading volumes and time left for maturity of the series. SGB had been in demand prior to the budget due to better taxation as compared to other financial forms of gold. Further low  trading volumes can cause some price spikes leading to high valuation. However, the maturity price of SGB is determined solely on the ongoing gold prices and that is dependent on many  parameters.
Gold prices in India are driven by the import duties as well as international gold prices and the USD-INR currency movement. Geopolitical events, central bank purchases, inflation, rate cuts are a few factors affecting international gold price movement. Given that the valuation of all other gold investments like gold ETF, physical gold is  based on the domestic price (which is driven by the above factors), SGB remains the best investment in gold due to zero cost, tax free returns and the additional 9. Further, premium turnover on index options has grown 426% in the last three years, compared to 30% growth in the cash turnover market.
High-fixed-return schemes like peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and low-rated bonds have traction among those looking for a regular return. Even unregulated schemes like managed farmlands, renewable asset leasing, gold savings schemes, invoice discounting, fractional property etc. are finding favour with ordinary investors as they promise high returns. Investors are simply unaware of these schemes’ structures or how they work. They still pour in money as they do not know how to weigh the risks with returns.

While regulators are making huge efforts to caution investors against dealing with unregulated entities, a few tax nudges can go a long way in getting investors to move in the right direction. This is even more essential now, as investor memory is short and most of the new investors have only seen rising markets. They do not really understand the downside of the high-risk strategies.
Indian citizens are allowed to invest in government bonds through the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) retail direct scheme. This provides a good option for citizens to lock in rates for 1-30 year periods. However, the uptake is low as the returns are fully taxable, and the platform is difficult to comprehend. In the past, bonds like deep-discount and tax-free infrastructure bonds have been popular with citizens. To encourage retail participation in long-term bonds and provide citizens with a viable option to invest for 1-40 years, the returns on certain sovereign bonds up to a limit can be made tax-free. Further, the government needs to make it easy to buy these bonds, like the sovereign gold bond scheme, to improve the adoption of government securities at a retail level.

Income tax deadline looms: Know your ITR forms to avoid penalties
Planning for retirement is the top financial concern for all Indians, and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a great instrument that can be used to build the retirement corpus and post-retirement pension. However, discrepancies exist in tax benefits for the salaried and the self-employed. While the salaried get the benefit of a tax deduction on corporate contributions under Section 80 CCD(2) in the old and new tax regimes, the self-employed get deductions only under the old tax regime under Section 80CCD(1B). This is unfair to them. To balance this disparity, the contributions by individuals to the NPS under Section 80CCD(1B) should be allowed as a deduction in the new tax regime as well.
If planning for retirement corpus is burdensome, planning for post-retirement regular income is a bigger challenge. Retirees often fall prey to schemes from unregulated entities or invest in low-rated bonds, mainly driven by the need for a reasonable post-retirement income. The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) and the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS) are two schemes widely used by retirees for regular income. The returns from these schemes can be made tax-free for senior citizens so that they can lead a better life and not have to take undue risks.
Also Read:
Budget may hike tax on F&O trading. Here’s what it could mean
All these measures will help citizens have better personal finances over tax deductions (which, in most cases, get spent). The availability of government schemes like the NPS, SCSS, POMIS and government securities with additional tax benefits will nudge citizens to consider these regulated schemes over riskier/unregulated investments. This will also ensure household savings are not going into non-productive economic activity but nation-building.

The tax filing season is here. It is a taxing time for most people as they find the tax system complex and confusing. Deciding the regime, the ITR form and putting all data together for the filing are the common challenges. While individuals are focused on the housing sections and other tax deductions, there are 3 areas which need attention as well.
First, taxpayers need to check the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and reconcile it with their data. The AIS is a single, comprehensive document  which shows all financial transactions in a financial year. It carries information on income from salary, tax deducted at source, interest income, dividends, securities & immovable assets transactions, cash deposits, remittances and many more financial transactions.
It is essential to match the AIS with the taxpayer’s records to ensure accuracy in filing returns and avoiding notices and penalties. Many taxpayers are not aware of the need to do this. In case of a mismatch of data, the taxpayer has the ability to provide feedback and  the same is taken up with the reporting source.
Second, add capital gains from stocks and mutual funds to the tax calculation. There is a lack of awareness on the need to pay capital gains taxes. Further, the capital gains are also not being reported correctly with the sale date being shown as the last date of the financial year and calculation errors. For mutual funds, taxpayers can access the capital gains statement for the financial year, from the mutual fund registrars CAMS and Karvy Fintech. The statement has all the information on the date of purchase, date of sale and amount of capital gains tax. The statement can be downloaded in the excel format for further use.
Third, do not forget to declare foreign stocks holding. Most individuals believe that they do not need to declare foreign stocks until they sell the same. This is not true. Foreign stocks acquired directly or through company restricted stock unit (RSU) need to be declared under the Schedule of foreign assets(FA) in ITR2/ITR3. Schedule FA reporting is done on the accounting year of the foreign country, in Indian rupees. The assets need to be converted at the telegraphic transfer buying rate which is the exchange rate provided by State Bank of India.
Further, the capital gains on sale of foreign stocks is different from domestic stocks. The long-term capital gains on foreign stocks is applicable post holding the stock for 2 years and is taxed at 20% with indexations. Foreign stocks held for less than 2 years are taxable at slab. Dividend income from foreign stocks is to be shown in income from other sources and is taxed at slab. In case of withholding tax deduction by the foreign country, the taxpayer can claim tax credit under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement but would need to file Form 67 and then make the relevant declarations in Schedule TR and FSI.
The ITR filing of foreign stocks and capital gains is complex and it is recommended to take the help of a chartered account to file returns.
All the above are very important to file the ITR correctly and taxpayers must start working on the same right away.

Here are a few things investors can check to get their equity holdings to give better returns.
Mrin Agarwal Financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pvt. Ltd and co-founder of Womantra.
Of late, most enquiries around equity investments especially regarding systematic investment plans (SIP) are on investing in SIPs for short term periods of 1-2 years. Driven by good returns over the last couple of years, some investors believe the same performance will pan out over the next few years as well.
Based on previous market cycles, times like this, when lay investors make short term bets on equities, actually signals caution. Overconfidence precedes carelessness! It is appropriate for equity investors to take a reality check on their equity investors to take a reality check on their equity investments and investment behaviour.
Here are a few things investors can check to get their equity holdings to give better returns.
Firstly, have the equity investments been made for a financial goal or because markets were doing well and it seemed like a good time to make some quick money? All around one hears stories of fantabulous returns made in a short period. Tag a financial goal to all equity investments and have at least 7-10 years holding period. Investors who cannot do so should exit and invest as per their investment horizon. For example, if the holding period is 2 years, an ultra-short term fund or arbitrage fund would be recommended and not an equity fund as it can be very volatile.
Second, simplify the equity holdings. Investors tend to have too many funds. 4-5 funds spread across a large cap index fund, a midcap fund and a flexicap fund is all that a portfolio needs. Diversify within fund houses too to reduce overlap of stocks and to get a differentiated investment style. Allocate additional funds to existing funds.
Third, keep in mind a few things about equity markets. Markets will go up and down and do not give linear returns. Focus on what can be controlled like how much to invest, where to invest and remaining invested, over fretting about market movements. Long term investors gain nothing by checking prices/ NAVs everyday. Checking the portfolio on a half yearly basis is good enough.
Fourth, having a modest view always helps. Quick returns in the past are more luck than investing skill. Stock tips and influencer videos do not create long term wealth. Keep out the noise and do not get swayed by what everybody around is talking about. Tone down return expectations to an average return of 10-12% p.a. in the long term from equities.
Finally, keep the investment strategy simple. With equity markets doing well, investors seem to believe investments like stock baskets, equity trading, F&O etc will give better returns than mutual funds. There is no data to prove this. Further, individual investors do not have the resources to get the right information or the time required to micro manage direct equities. Mutual funds are best suited for individual investors.
A financial journey is a matter of choices and every choice investors make, makes their financial life.

Equities must be present in everyone’s portfolio, but that doesn’t mean you should take unnecessary risks. A simple combination of a Nifty 50 index fund and a Nifty 150 index fund might just be what the doctor ordered.
An investment has to be chosen based on two parameters – time frame of investment and risk.
The S&P BSE Sensex is hovering near all-time-high levels. And investors have caught the fever; the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) virus. There are many queries about what the next best investment is. They are afraid of being left behind as equity markets race ahead, and perhaps seeing their neighbour or friend making more money than they have so far. The reality is that quick returns are a one-off and cannot be sustained. Further, there is no such thing as the best investment that will consistently give 15 percent returns without any volatility.
The question still remains: Where to invest and how to go about managing these investments? Here is a process with five products to get the financial journey right for new investors and for existing investors to do a check and course correction.
Expect the unexpected
Job loss, a sudden medical emergency in the family, large repair expenses—these are just some unexpected events that can occur. Most often, people believe this will happen to others and not them. And when such an unfortunate event befalls them, it is common to hear that investments are not accessible and one ends up relying on loans. Before jumping into investing or taking a loan, keep five to six months of expenses in a fixed deposit. This can help you tide over financial emergencies.
External health insurance for internal peace
The salaried, especially younger employees,
tend to rely only on employer-provided health insurance
. However, these days, people at all ages are getting various illnesses and the cost of treatment is skyrocketing, meaning that the typical Rs 3-5 lakh of insurance cover provided under a group insurance scheme would prove insufficient. Also, one has to factor in job insecurity and instances where people prefer to follow their passion projects rather than stick to.a 9 to 5 routine. Given this, it is imperative to have external health insurance of at least Rs 5-10 lakh to ensure continuity of heath cover.
Put simply, one should take the plunge into the investment world only after ensuring an emergency corpus and health cover.
The “best” equity fund portfolio
An investment has to be chosen based primarily on two parameters—time frame and risk. The time horizon should be based on a financial goal and the risk is based on the risk an investor can or needs to take. Often, there is a gap between the amount required to be invested for a goal and the amount one can actually spare. In such instances, the money may have to be put into higher-risk avenues to meet the goal within the set time frame.
Given long-term inflation of 6-7 percent per annum, investors will need to consider instruments that beat this rate. One such investment is an equity fund. There are many categories within equity funds and it gets difficult to choose the allocation between those focused on large-, mid- and small-caps. Further,
mid- and small-cap stocks come with higher volatility,
something most investors find difficult to deal with. Investors are also confused with various theme- and sector-based funds.
One simple strategy is to invest in a combination of a simple Nifty 50 index fund and a Nifty 150 index fund. While this may not necessarily give the highest returns, it firstly removes the choice dilemma and secondly, helps investors remain invested.
Investors tend to churn mutual fund portfolios regularly based on recent performance, thus earning lower returns than the fund. Further, the SPIVA India year-end 2023 report by S&P Dow Jones shows that in a 10-year period, more than 50 percent of funds failed to beat the benchmark on an absolute returns basis, thus making a case for passive investing.
Plan for the short term with debt funds
Equities are for the longer term (at least seven years). For goals falling within three or four years, short-duration debt funds are a better bet, providing consistent returns. These funds have high-quality bond portfolios and exhibit lower volatility compared to other debt fund categories. Short-duration debt funds are all-weather funds and make returns through a combination of accrual and capital gains. They are preferred over fixed deposits as they provide better flexibility on withdrawal along with the possibility of better returns due to active duration management.
Think retirement, think NPS
Investors are getting more conscious about investing for retirement early on, given the expenses and corpus requirement.
The National Pension System
has all the elements that can help reach the required corpus. The lock-in till age 60 ensures money is left to compound and the equity allocation ensures higher returns. The additional tax benefit over Section 80C instruments is another positive.
These five products can go a long way in simplifying and magnifying one’s financial life.

An argument that is often heard against the National Pension Scheme(NPS) is the long lock-in till age of 60 years. Another concern is the accessibility of the corpus in case of early retirement.
Subscribers have for long been used to defined benefit scheme like the employee provident fund which gives a fixed return and find it difficult to estimate the corpus in NPS. They worry about how markets could be in the long run and the uncertainty associated with not getting a fixed return. One of the reasons annuity plans from insurance companies have so much acceptance is because they are sold with the promise of a certain amount and pension based on that.
However, these options may not provide a sufficient retirement corpus, given the limited returns in these plans. Based on current expenses of ₹75,000-1 lakh, the retirement corpus required at age 50, on an inflation adjusted basis, would be ₹6-8 crore for a 35-year old. For this, the individual will need to invest ₹0. The advantage there is that, at this point of time, 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn tax free and 40% goes into an annuity. A new feature in NPS also allows for withdrawal of the lump sum amount periodically under a systematic withdrawal plan (SLW).
The advantage that NPS has over equity mutual funds is lower cost and the pension. Retirees find it very difficult to plan for regular income from their corpus, whether they are 50 or 60 years old. This is something they do not need to worry about with NPS, since it provides periodic returns through pension and SLW. Equity funds have better liquidity and the investor can choose the risk allocation, but the ability to remain invested is the biggest hindrance in building a good retirement corpus.
The question that begets is whether early retirement is even possible, given the investment of ₹2-1. Policy Coverage

Do you have a query about your 
finances for which you want 
independent and confidential i
nformation and view?
Are you feeling overwhelmed with 
financial decisions and need to speak to someone who can understand your situation?
Do you want these interactions 
without any sales agenda?
Finding a trusted financial advisor is often a difficult task. Sure, there are many agents whose sole intention is to sell you something, that may not always be in your best interest. There are many online investment platforms available but they lack human interaction. Even if one finds a financial advisor, they may be inexperienced or not have holistic knowledge.
Finding someone with the right experience, knowledge (on investing, borrowing and planning) and with whom you can have an open conversation about your finances, without them driving any sales agenda is cumbersome.
Finsafe India, which has pioneered financial education in India (yes we are the ONLY financial wellness company in India, which only educates & does not manage monies) brings to you FINANCIAL COUNSELLING. The financial counselling service is being facilitated by Finsafe India through certified financial planners.
